The ckanext-theme-sddi is a CKAN extension crafted to provide a specialized theme for the Smart District Data Infrastructure [(SDDI)](https://www.asg.ed.tum.de/en/gis/projects/smart-district-data-infrastructure/).  This extension enhances the CKAN platform by integrating a custom theme that aligns with the SDDIâ€™s visual and functional requirements.

### Funcionality

It is defined according to the following UML diagram:
